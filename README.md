# Operationalizing Machine Learning with Microsoft Machine Learning Studio

*TODO:* Write an overview to your project.
## Overview

In a typical Machine Learning application, like it happens for any software product, it's critical to bring the application into production, monitor it, and update it when needed. The process of automating the process of getting software into production is named **DevOps**. Thanks to the Microsoft Azure environment, we can **automate** the process of productionizing any **Machine Learning Application** by using the **MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)** features provided by the environment, that is the application of the **DevOps** best-practices and principles to the **Machine Learning Operations**.

Below is the list of steps to operationalize a **Machine Learning Application**:

1. Create a **Dataset** with the data of the problem we want to study
2. Create a **Model** leveraging the **Automated ML** feature
3. Deploy the **Model** and create an **Endpoint** to interact with the model
4. Consume the **Endpoint**
5. Create a **Pipeline** in Python SDK using **Jupyter Notebook** on a **Python 3 Environment**

The **Dataset** contains data about a **Bank Marketing** campaign, and the **goal** of the **model** is to predict if a **client** is going to subscribe (the target variable is indicated as **y** which can be "yes" or "no"). The finite number of states of the target variable is a good fit for using a **Classification** algorithm.


## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step.

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screencasts required to demonstrate key steps. 

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
